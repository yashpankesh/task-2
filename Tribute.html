    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber ; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American 
        comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run
         business called Timely Comics which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary 
         creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing 
         house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.

        In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve
         Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man,
          Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, 
          the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s 
          pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged 
          the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies.
         In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
        
        Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company,
         and frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters on 
         which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the highest grossing 
         person in film of all time.[2] He continued independent creative ventures into his 90s until his death 
         in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the
          Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.</p>
